# Sankey_Plot
visualization in R


Sankey plot is very intuitive to describe the differences and connections between the major 
categories, I used to describe the differences and connections between the two auto parts(common and special)
and their adapted models.

Besides, width of the connection is shown proportionally to the sale quantities.

Please look at the R code for demonstration.
